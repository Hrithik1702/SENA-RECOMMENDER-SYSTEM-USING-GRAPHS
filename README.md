## <b>Problem Description:</b><br>
<div align="justify">
Technology world today revolves around making robust use of data available in abundance to gain insights from it and incorporate them in business activities to improve their services to consumers. One such domain of interest is the domain of product purchases in which there is a Long Tail Problem, wherein the number of popular products is very small when compared to the total volume of products available. Thus, recommendation systems prove helpful in recommending the unpopular products based on the users’ interests. There still prevails a “Cold Start” issue where the new users to the system have very few preferences and “Data Sparsity” issue wherein the number of items each user rates are very small compared to the total number of items. Hence, based on the principle of Homophily, incorporating social information provides a solution and helps in making recommendations based on neighbor preferences. This task is popularly known as the social recommendation task. This project aims at performing a comparative analysis on the social recommendation models and inferring how they perform based on the network structure i.e., the communities that are present in the user-user interaction data (Social Information).
